# 0x02. Redis basic

This project is part of the ALX Backend Specialization.

It focuses on using Redis with Python to implement a simple caching system, demonstrating how to:

- Store and retrieve various types of data
- Use UUIDs for unique key generation
- Set up Redis as a local or containerized service
- Serialize and deserialize data
- Use Redis built-in features like counting and expiring keys

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies

- Language: Python 3.7+
- Redis server (locally or via Docker)
- Redis Python client (`redis-py`)
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (target environment)
- PEP8 code style (`pycodestyle` 2.5)

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- Redis fundamentals
- Python type annotations
- Data persistence and serialization
- Decorators and function tracing
- Storing and retrieving byte, string, int, and float types
- Using UUID to generate keys

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Install Redis**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get -y install redis-server
   sudo service redis-server start
